# Mini SQL Database

## General Process & Overview

<p>One of the first languages that I've learned is C++. I use C++ for coding in LeetCode, mainly because it's one of the fastest and most memory-efficient languages. C++ holds a special place in my heart and is one of my all-time favorite languages. While coming up with the idea for this project, I also set a goal to make this project as clean and memory efficient as possible. This goal led me to integrate the components of this project using polymorphism and different file structures while also learning about how to properly manage the memory. Using a combination of memory addresses, pointers, and more has greatly improved the memory management of this project. Not only has this project helped me learn how to implement better file and memory management, but also provided a solid understanding on how SQL structures work! <br> But anyway, let's get into the process. To create this project, I first researched some commands to implement. Then, I created a file structure plan in order to plan how to implement each part of the project. Lastly, using a series of hpp files for the command structures and cpp files to implement the command structure.  </p>
